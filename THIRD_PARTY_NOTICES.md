# Third-party code

Code in this repository that comes from other projects keeps its license; the license file sits next to the code.

## Android fork dependencies

The Android work is maintained at `tencentmalos/MacNativeGames`, separately from
upstream's Apple distribution. `android/dependencies.json` pins the external
Foundation and Oboe source checkouts; no dependency source or private game data
is copied into this repository.

- Foundation `modules/audio`: MIT, including its callback mixer and Oboe endpoint.
- Foundation `modules/input`: GPL-2.0-or-later, Copyright 2026 shadPS4 Emulator
  Project; native InputHub and the Android Kotlin collector retain these notices.
  Android bridge/test files using this API are GPL-2.0-or-later. The combined
  Android application includes GPL components; it must not be represented as an
  MIT-only binary. The existing MacNativeGames MIT files retain their notices.
- Oboe: Apache-2.0; use the LICENSE and AUTHORS in the pinned source checkout.
- Android ABI emitter adaptations: `jhaizhou-ops/d2r-mobile` at
  `758f5d41509af5cd38b7eb934bc2334bdb3e3342`, MIT, Copyright 2026 jhaizhou.
  The existing `games/totk/third_party/d2r/LICENSE` carries this notice.
- `android/third_party/d2r/sha256.c`, `sha256.h` and the syntax conversion in
  `android/tools/asm_elf.py`: adapted from D2R Mobile at the same `758f5d4`
  revision, MIT. The SHA-256 subset retains its license beside the source.

The Android study builds are local development artifacts, not a binary release.
Their source dependencies and applicable notices must accompany any distribution.
